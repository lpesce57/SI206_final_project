This project accessed 4 different APIs using Python code to gather information about various movies. Additionally,we accessed Open Weather's API to determine if there was a correlation between the popularity of a movie and the weather the day it was released. We chose to access the weather in Ann Arbor for each date. We then used SQL to insert the information collected into a database and ulitmatley plotted this data with Matplotlib. Finally, we made several calculations and stored the results in a txt file.

Locating Various Data:
-APIs: imdb_api.py, omdb_api.py, open_weather_api.py and rotten_tomatoes_api.py
-Database: final_project.db
-Code for Plotting the Data: data_plot.py
-Visualizations: figure_1.png, figure_2.png and figure_3.png
-Text Calculations: average_omdb_rating.txt, average_rating.txt
-In-depth Report: SI206 Final Project Report
